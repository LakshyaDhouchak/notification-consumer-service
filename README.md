## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Statement & Overview

The `notification-consumer-service` is the dedicated communication layer of the Car-Go architecture. It completely **decouples** the core booking logic from the time-consuming process of sending emails. This ensures the booking API is blazing fast and provides **ultimate resilience** against service outages through **Kafka's built-in retry mechanism**.

It uses **Spring for Apache Kafka** to process events and **Spring Boot Starter Mail** for reliable email dispatching via Gmail's SMTP.

## âœ¨ Core Technology & Features

| Feature | Component | Benefit to the System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Event Ingestion** | `BookingConfirmationConsumer` | Uses **Spring Kafka** to passively consume events, maximizing throughput and ensuring **Asynchronous Processing**. |
| **Guaranteed Delivery** | `RuntimeException` Handler | **Fault Tolerance:** Any temporary failure (e.g., SMTP timeout) triggers a **Kafka retry**, preventing lost notifications. |
| **Data Mapping** | `JsonDeserializer` | Seamlessly converts raw JSON messages into the typed `BookingConfirmationEvent` DTO. |
| **Extensibility** | `EmailNotificationService` | Ready to be extended for other channels like SMS (Twilio) or push notifications (Firebase). |
| **Monitoring** | `spring-boot-starter-actuator` | Built-in endpoints for instant health checks and service monitoring. |
